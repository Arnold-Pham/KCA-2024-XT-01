# General Database Documentation

[Fran√ßais](../../fr/convex/README.md) | [English](README.md)

This project uses a database schema designed to manage a system of servers, members, roles, channels, messages, and invitation codes. Each table is defined with specific fields and clear relationships between entities. This documentation provides an overview of the tables and their respective schemas.
